### About the project

In this project, the HTML and CSS files were already given. This is the finale project of the first chapter and the goal is to use the previously learned knowledge to finish this game. DOM manipulation, EventListeners, usage of class lists and storing the active player were all part of this project.

### About the game

This is a two player game. The goal is to reach a minimum score of 100 by rolling the dice. The active player can roll as many times as desired. To save the current score make sure to use the HOLD button. If a 1 is rolled the current score is lost and the next players turn starts.
